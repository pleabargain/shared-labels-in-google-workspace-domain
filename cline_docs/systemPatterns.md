# System Patterns

## Core Workflow
1. Email Reception
   - User receives email in their inbox
   - Email is initially only visible to recipient

2. Label Application
   - User identifies relevant shared label
   - User applies shared label to email
   - System processes label application

3. Access Control
   - System checks user permissions for shared label
   - System grants access to users with appropriate permissions
   - Email becomes visible in shared label view

## Technical Components
